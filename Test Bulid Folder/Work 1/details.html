    <h1>HAMPI, INDIA.</h1>
    <p>Hampi was the magnificent capital of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1565),<br>
    a powerful South Indian Hindu kingdom, renowned for its immense wealth, <br>stunning temples,
    and sophisticated urban planning, reaching its peak under <br> Krishna Devaraya; it became one of the world's largest cities
    before <br>being sacked and abandoned after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, leaving <br>behind vast ruins now a UNESCO World Heritage site, 
    showcasing grand <br> palaces, religious structures, and unique boulder-strewn landscapes.
